# Content-Aware Resize (Seam Carving)

**Content-Aware Resize** is a C# project that implements the **Seam Carving** algorithm, a technique for resizing images while preserving the most important content. Unlike traditional resizing methods, Seam Carving intelligently removes or adds pixels along the least noticeable paths (seams) in the image, ensuring that the most significant features remain intact.

## Features

- **Seam Carving Algorithm**:
  - Dynamically resizes images by removing or adding seams based on energy maps.
  - Preserves important content by targeting low-energy regions (e.g., uniform backgrounds) for removal.

- **Energy Map Calculation**:
  - Computes the energy of each pixel to identify the least noticeable paths for seam removal.
  - Visualizes the energy map for better understanding of the algorithm's decisions.

- **Interactive GUI**:
  - Built with **Windows Forms** for easy image loading, resizing, and visualization.
  - Allows users to specify the number of seams to remove and view the results in real-time.

- **Image Saving**:
  - Save the resized images in various formats (e.g., BMP) after processing.

## How It Works

1. **Energy Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the energy of each pixel in the image using gradient magnitude.
2. **Seam Identification**: It identifies the least noticeable vertical or horizontal seams (paths of low energy).
3. **Seam Removal**: The identified seams are removed, and the image is resized accordingly.
4. **Repeat**: The process is repeated until the desired image size is achieved.

## Example Usage

- Load an image using the "Open Image" button.
- Specify the number of seams to remove.
- Click "Resize" to apply the Seam Carving algorithm.
- Save the resized image using the "Save Image" button.

## Why This Project?

This project demonstrates the practical application of the **Seam Carving** algorithm, showcasing how advanced image processing techniques can be used to intelligently resize images while preserving their most important features. It is a great example of combining algorithms with user-friendly interfaces.
